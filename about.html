                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Even though I'm only sixteen and a half, I've already found a real passion in the world of development and coding. 
                    It feels like just yesterday I was tinkering with my first lines of code, and now I spend a significant amount of my time diving deep
                     into various programming languages and projects.<br><br>

                    What really sparked my interest was the power to create and build things from scratch using
                     just lines of text. That initial curiosity quickly blossomed into a full-blown fascination. While I do 
                     a lot of general coding and development, I've found a particularly engaging niche in the FiveM community. There's 
                     something really exciting about contributing to and creating experiences within that platform. It's a fantastic way 
                     to see code come to life in a dynamic and interactive environment. <br><br>
                    
                    My core values revolve around continuous learning, problem-solving, and collaboration. 
                    The tech landscape is constantly evolving, and I believe staying curious and always seeking new knowledge
                     is crucial. I also genuinely enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and finding elegant solutions through code. 
                     Finally, I value the opportunity to connect with other developers, share ideas, and learn from each other. It's an amazing community
                      to be a part of, and I'm excited to see where my coding journey takes me next!</p>
